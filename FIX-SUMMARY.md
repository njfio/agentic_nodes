# Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. API Key Environment Variable Error
**Problem**: Application was requiring `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable at startup, causing container to crash.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `OPENAI_API_KEY` from required environment variables in `utils/config-validation.js`
- Updated application to store API keys in user settings within the database
- Added API key fields to User model with secure storage (select: false)

### 2. Rate Limiter Reference Error
**Problem**: `apiRateLimiter` was not defined in `routes/api-improved.js`

**Solution**:
- Changed all occurrences of `apiRateLimiter` to `apiLimiter` (the correct import name)
- Fixed in 3 locations: workflow versions and image routes

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **utils/config-validation.js**
   - Removed OPENAI_API_KEY validation
   - Updated configuration logging

2. **models/User.js**
   - Added `settings.apiKeys` schema for storing API keys
   - Added methods: `getApiKey()`, `setApiKey()`, `getAllApiKeys()`

3. **middleware/apiKeyMiddleware.js** (NEW)
   - Created middleware to enrich requests with API keys from user settings
   - Added endpoints for API key management

4. **routes/api.js**
   - Added API key enrichment middleware to OpenAI routes
   - Added API key management endpoints

5. **routes/api-v2.js**
   - Added API key enrichment to chat/agent routes
   - Added API key management endpoints

6. **routes/api-improved.js**
   - Fixed `apiRateLimiter` → `apiLimiter` references

### New Features:
- User-specific API key storage
- API key management endpoints:
  - GET `/api/settings/api-keys` - Get masked API keys
  - PUT `/api/settings/api-keys` - Update API key
- Automatic API key retrieval from user settings
- Support for multiple AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity)

## Docker Usage

The application now starts without requiring API keys in the environment:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - No API keys needed!
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/multimodal
  # No OPENAI_API_KEY required!
```

## User Instructions

1. Start the application normally
2. Login to your account
3. Go to Settings → API Keys
4. Enter your API keys for each service
5. Save and start using AI features

The application is now ready to run without environment variable errors!
