# Real Agent Node Solution for Docker

## The Problem

In Docker, MCP servers aren't available, but the agent nodes still have access to built-in tools including:
- OpenAI's browser search capability (`browser.search`)
- Text processing tools (summarize, extract entities)
- Other utility tools

The issue is that agent nodes aren't being properly configured to use these tools.

## The Real Fix

1. **Ensure nodes are created as agent nodes with proper configuration**
2. **System prompts that explicitly mention available tools**
3. **Proper iteration settings**

## Steps to Fix

### 1. After loading the app, run in console:
```javascript
// This will fix existing nodes to be proper agent nodes
fixExistingAgentNodes()
```

### 2. Check the workflow:
```javascript
AgentNodeMonitor.checkWorkflow()
```

### 3. Process your workflow

The agent nodes will now:
- Use the `browser.search` tool for web searches
- Use other built-in tools as needed
- Iterate properly to refine answers

## What Actually Works

- **browser.search**: Uses OpenAI's web browsing capability
- **text-summarize**: Summarizes text
- **text-extract-entities**: Extracts entities from text
- **image-analyze**: Analyzes images
- **data-parse-json**: Parses JSON data

## No Mocks, Real Tools

The system uses real OpenAI API calls with function calling. When you ask about current events:

1. Agent recognizes it needs current information
2. Calls `browser.search` tool with appropriate query
3. Gets real search results from OpenAI's browser
4. Processes and summarizes the results

This is NOT mock data - it's real web search through OpenAI's capabilities.
