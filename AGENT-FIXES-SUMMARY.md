# Agent Node Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Function Calling Format**
- **Problem**: The agent was using the old OpenAI API format (`functions` and `function_call`)
- **Fix**: Updated to use the new format (`tools` and `tool_calls`)
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (line 449)

### 2. **Conversation History Not Maintained**
- **Problem**: Messages array was recreated in each iteration, losing conversation context
- **Fix**: Moved messages array initialization outside the iteration loop to maintain full conversation history
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (lines 346-418)

### 3. **Tool Results Not Properly Handled**
- **Problem**: Tool results were not being properly fed back into the conversation
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper handling for multiple tool calls in a single response
  - Tool results are now added as `tool` role messages with proper `tool_call_id`
  - After tool execution, the loop continues to get the model's response to the tool results
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (lines 482-540)

### 4. **Iteration Logic Issues**
- **Problem**: Agent would stop after first response without attempting to use tools or iterate
- **Fix**: 
  - When model provides a response without tools, we now ask if more tools are needed
  - Added better completion detection keywords
  - Properly maintain assistant messages in conversation history
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (lines 549-579)

### 5. **System Prompt Not Encouraging Tool Use**
- **Problem**: System prompt was too generic and didn't encourage proactive tool usage
- **Fix**: Updated system prompt to explicitly encourage:
  - Breaking down complex tasks
  - Using tools to improve answer quality
  - Step-by-step reasoning
  - Iterative refinement
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (lines 81-86, 227-232)

### 6. **Tool Instructions Updated**
- **Problem**: System prompt mentioned old `function_call` format
- **Fix**: Updated to explain that the model will automatically call tools when needed
- **File**: `/client/agent/agent-processor.js` (lines 413-417)

## How Agent Nodes Now Work

1. **Initialization**: When an agent node is created, it's configured with:
   - Tools from both built-in and MCP sources
   - A system prompt that encourages autonomous behavior
   - Iteration settings (max 5 by default)

2. **Processing Loop**:
   - Maintains conversation history across iterations
   - Sends requests with available tools
   - When tools are called:
     - Executes all requested tools
     - Adds results to conversation
     - Continues iteration for model to process results
   - When no tools are called:
     - Adds response to conversation
     - Asks if more tools are needed (if not at max iterations)
     - Detects completion phrases to stop appropriately

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - Supports multiple tool calls in one response
   - Properly formats tool results for the model
   - Maintains tool call history in agent memory

## Testing

Created a test file at `/test-agent.html` that demonstrates:
- Simple question answering
- Tool usage
- Multi-step reasoning with multiple tool calls

## Remaining Considerations

1. **API Key Configuration**: Ensure OpenAI API key is properly configured
2. **Tool Availability**: Verify MCP tools are loaded and available
3. **Model Selection**: Ensure using a model that supports function calling (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits during multi-iteration processing

The agent nodes should now behave in a truly agentic manner, using tools proactively and iterating through problems to provide comprehensive solutions.
