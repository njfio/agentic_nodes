   - Goal-Oriented Planner: Breaks down into goals and subgoals
   - Tree of Thoughts: Explores multiple solution paths
   - Reflexion: Self-critique and iterative improvement

2. REASONING SETTINGS:

   - Reasoning depth (1-5 levels)
   - Show/Hide reasoning process in output

3. REFLECTION CAPABILITIES:
   - Periodic self-reflection on progress
   - Customizable reflection frequency (every N iterations)
   - Custom reflection prompts
   - Reflection history tracking

4. ENHANCED FEATURES:
   - Perplexity API integration for real-time search
   - Tool usage with automatic retries
   - Iteration history preservation
   - Intelligent completion detection
   - Network resilience with fallbacks

5. UI IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Reasoning style selector in agent node editor
   - Reflection settings configuration
   - Perplexity API key management
   - Better error messages and status updates

To use these features:
1. Double-click an agent node to open settings
2. Configure reasoning style and depth
3. Enable/disable reflection as needed
4. Set your Perplexity API key for web search
5. Run your workflow and watch the agent reason!

The agent will now show its thinking process, use tools intelligently,
reflect on its progress, and adapt its approach based on the reasoning style.
